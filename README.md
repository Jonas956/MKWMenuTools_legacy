MKWMenuTools is a Tool to automaticly apply patches to your Mario Kart Wii SZS file.

Please note that this is NOT an editor. It will replace existing files inside of your SZS file with the templates and images that you provide.

This means if you change the Live View Screen for example it will replace the live.brlyt and live.tpl inside of your Race.szs

It automaticly will do stuff such as making a Gif MenuSingle, repairing your SZS file etc.

It uses [Wiimms SZS Tools](https://szs.wiimm.de/) and Powershell to do so.

## Installation

You will need [Wiimms SZS Tools](https://szs.wiimm.de/) installed on your computer and you will need access to the Windows Powershell.

## Usage

Place your SZS file into the SZS folder. If you want to use patches that use custom images drag into the Images folder after reading the instructions.txt

It will automaticly convert your .png files into matching .tpl files. It will not extract the frames of a .gif file for you (at least as of now)

Example on how its meant to be done:
